### Comments

- I didn't add the "Sort by Name" and "Sort by Date" functionalities because I had already gone overtime. I would simply use a lodash sort/order to achieve this
- I didn't add the Roboto font because of the same reason, although it should be very trivial to add
- I debated whether to reset the search text when switching between ToDo and Done but left it there. If I had to reset, I would just add a route guard in the SearchAndFilter component
